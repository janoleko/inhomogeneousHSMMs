This repository contains R code for the paper [“Hidden semi-Markov models with inhomogeneous state dwell-time distributions”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947325000477).

In the paper, we extend the model class of hidden semi-Markov models to allow for covariates affecting the state dwell-time distribution of the latent Markov chain. We conduct simulation experiments and a case study, to demonstrate feasibility and practical relevance.
